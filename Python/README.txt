This was a side project I started during my first semester of College, Freshmen year.

I started this project becuase I thought it would be useful to fellow peers and 
will give me a better understanding of Python.

This projet later evolved into a full blown Java Applet during my first semester 
of Sophomore year with the help of a professor who mentored me and the dean of 
the School of Engineering who sponsored the project.

NOTE: This project was for me to get my feet wet with Python so it is not optimized 
or well commented.
